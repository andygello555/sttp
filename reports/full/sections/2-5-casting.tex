    \textit{``This week I worked more on the programming language I am creating. In particular I added a lookup table of cast functions which contains the functions needed for casting each type to another type. Of course you arenâ€™t able to cast any type to any type. Then I moved onto the operator computation lookup table."}\\[0.5em]

Casting is a large part of \verb|sttp| as it is a dynamically-typed programming language. Expressions within \verb|sttp| often use casting to make sure that an operation can be carried out successfully. In most cases, the \verb|sttp| interpreter will choose to behave `dynamically' rather than `erroring-out'.
