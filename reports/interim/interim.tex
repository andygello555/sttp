\begin{abstract}

Although there exists many tools for testing and developing web-based APIs, there are not many solutions which provide full user freedom when it comes to control-flow. This project proposes a solution in the form of a dynamically typed, interpreted, scripting language with features enabling the use of web-based APIs `out-of-the-box', as well as other helpful tooling.

\chapter*{Project Specification}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Project Specification}

The \verb|sttp| (amalgamation of \textit{scripting} and \textit{HTTP}) is a dynamically typed, interpreted, scripting language written in Go using the participle parser generator by Alec Thomas\textsuperscript{\cite{thomas_2021}}.

%%% Introduction
\chapter{Introduction}

This interim report includes the explanation and reasoning behind the test programs I have written in the first term, along with instructions on how to run and use them.

\begin{center}
    The test programs that were written and will be explained:
    \vspace{-1em}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A simple four function calculator
        \item Regex parser that generates a minimised DFA
        \item A simple web-API designed to aid in the production of the \verb|sttp| programming language
    \end{enumerate}
\end{center}

Along with these test programs, the interim report also includes the reports that I wrote during the first term.

Also included is the progress that has been made towards implementing the final product and the journey of the \verb|sttp| programming language thus far. This includes any important engineering decisions that were made as well as any research or theory which influenced said decision.

\chapter{Development of sttp}

Development of \verb|sttp| begun in mid-October. I started by writing a formal definition of the grammar. Much of the grammar was inspired directly by Lua's grammar\textsuperscript{\cite{ierusalimschy_henrique-de-figueiredo_celes_2020}}.
